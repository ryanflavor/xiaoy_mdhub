### **3. User Interface Design Goals**

#### **Overall UX Vision**

Our goal is to create a professional, data-dense, and highly responsive operations dashboard. The design will prioritize information clarity and control convenience over elaborate visual aesthetics. The core vision is to enable a user to quickly and accurately assess the health of the entire market data hub from a single interface and intervene when necessary.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

- **Real-time Updates**: The dashboard's core data (gateway status, logs) must be pushed in real-time via WebSockets, eliminating the need for manual refreshes.
- **Direct Manipulation**: Users must be able to directly and instantly control backend services (e.g., start, stop gateways) via UI buttons.
- **Drill-Down Exploration**: Users should be able to click a high-level summary item (like an "error" status) to navigate to more detailed information (like specific error logs).

#### **Core Screens and Views**

1. **Status Dashboard**: A central view showing the real-time health, priority, and key metrics for all gateways in the account pool.
2. **Account Management**: An interface for managing the data source pool by enabling or disabling accounts stored in the database.
3. **Log Viewer**: A dedicated view for streaming real-time system logs, with functionality to filter by severity level.

#### **Accessibility**

The project will target **WCAG 2.1 Level A** as a baseline, ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible and that color contrast is sufficient for a professional work environment.

#### **Branding**

A clean, professional "tech-ops" aesthetic will be used. The interface will feature a **dark mode** theme by default to reduce eye strain during long monitoring sessions.

#### **Target Device and Platforms**

The primary target is **desktop web browsers**, as the dashboard is intended for use on large-screen workstations. The design will be responsive to ensure usability on tablets as well.
