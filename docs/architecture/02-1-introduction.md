### **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Local High-Availability Market Data Hub. It provides a detailed technical blueprint for the backend services, frontend dashboard, and their integration, ensuring a consistent and robust implementation that aligns with the project's requirements for performance, stability, and scalability.

- **Starter Template**: While a specific starter template was not designated, this architecture follows the conventions of a modern fullstack application built with **Next.js** within a **Turborepo/Nx-style Monorepo**. This approach is chosen to facilitate code sharing and streamlined build processes.
- **Source Documents**: This architecture is derived from the approved `project_brief.md`, `prd.md`, and `front-end-spec.md`.
