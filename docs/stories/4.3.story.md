# Story 4.3: Interactive Gateway Controls

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** system administrator, 
**I want** to have "Start," "Stop," and "Hard Restart" buttons for each gateway on the dashboard, 
**so that** I can perform direct manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Control buttons are added to each gateway's display on the dashboard.
2. Clicking a button sends a REST API request to the backend (e.g., `POST /api/accounts/{id}/restart`).
3. The backend executes the requested action via the `GatewayManager`.
4. The dashboard UI is updated in real-time to reflect the new state.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.2, the system now has:
- **Main Status Dashboard**: Fully functional dashboard at `/` with real-time gateway status visualization
- **Gateway Status Cards**: Individual cards showing ID, type, priority, and health status
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates via existing WebSocket service
- **Shadcn/ui Components**: Consistent UI using Card, Badge, Alert, and other components
- **TypeScript Types**: Complete interfaces in `packages/shared-types/src/websocket.ts`
- **Dashboard Data Hook**: Custom hook `use-dashboard-data.ts` for WebSocket state management

### Data Models
**Gateway Control API Endpoints** (new backend requirements):
```json
POST /api/accounts/{id}/start
POST /api/accounts/{id}/stop  
POST /api/accounts/{id}/restart
```

**API Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Gateway restart initiated",
  "gateway_id": "ctp_main_account",
  "action": "restart",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-25T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

**Gateway Control Button States**:
```typescript
type GatewayControlAction = 'start' | 'stop' | 'restart';
type ButtonState = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';
```

### Component Specifications
**Gateway Control Requirements**:
- Add interactive control buttons to each gateway card from Story 4.2
- Button placement should be intuitive and not interfere with status display
- Visual feedback for button states (loading, success, error)
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (stop, restart)
- Disable controls based on current gateway status (e.g., can't start an already running gateway)
- Real-time UI updates when backend actions complete

**UI/UX Requirements based on PRD** [Source: docs/prd/04-3-user-interface-design-goals.md]:
- **Direct Manipulation**: Users must be able to directly and instantly control backend services
- **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard must reflect backend state changes immediately
- **Professional Interface**: Clean, tech-ops aesthetic with dark mode support
- **WCAG 2.1 Level A**: Keyboard-accessible controls with sufficient color contrast

**Button Design using Shadcn/ui** [Source: docs/architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]:
- Use `Button` components with appropriate variants
- Use `AlertDialog` for confirmation dialogs
- Use `Tooltip` for button descriptions
- Use `Badge` for status indicators
- Implement loading states with appropriate visual feedback

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- Extend gateway card: `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/gateway-status-card.tsx` (existing)
- New control component: `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/gateway-controls.tsx` (new)
- New confirmation dialog: `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/gateway-control-dialog.tsx` (new)
- API service methods: `apps/web/src/services/api.ts` (extend existing)
- Backend API endpoints: `apps/api/app/api/routes/accounts.py` (extend existing)
- Gateway manager integration: `apps/api/app/services/gateway_manager.py` (extend existing)

### Technical Constraints
- **UI Library**: Must use Shadcn/ui components exclusively [Source: docs/architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **TypeScript**: All components must be fully typed [Source: docs/architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **API Integration**: Use existing REST API patterns from Story 2.2 account management
- **WebSocket Integration**: Leverage existing WebSocket for real-time status updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for failed control actions
- **State Management**: Coordinate button states with real-time WebSocket updates

### Integration with Existing Components
**Gateway Status Card Enhancement**:
- Extend existing `gateway-status-card.tsx` to include control buttons
- Maintain current layout and functionality while adding interactive controls
- Ensure controls are contextually appropriate based on gateway status

**API Service Integration**:
- Extend existing API service with gateway control methods
- Follow existing error handling patterns from account management APIs
- Implement proper request/response typing

**WebSocket Integration**:
- Listen for gateway status changes triggered by control actions
- Update UI state immediately when backend confirms action completion
- Handle scenarios where WebSocket updates arrive before API response

### Backend Implementation Requirements
**New API Endpoints** (extend existing `apps/api/app/api/routes/accounts.py`):
```python
@router.post("/accounts/{account_id}/start")
async def start_gateway(account_id: str):
    # Integrate with GatewayManager to start gateway
    pass

@router.post("/accounts/{account_id}/stop") 
async def stop_gateway(account_id: str):
    # Integrate with GatewayManager to stop gateway
    pass

@router.post("/accounts/{account_id}/restart")
async def restart_gateway(account_id: str):
    # Integrate with GatewayManager to restart gateway
    pass
```

**GatewayManager Integration** (extend existing `apps/api/app/services/gateway_manager.py`):
- Add methods for start, stop, and restart operations
- Ensure proper process management and cleanup
- Emit WebSocket events for status changes
- Handle edge cases and error scenarios

### Authentication and Authorization
Based on PRD authentication requirements:
- Ensure all control endpoints require proper authentication
- Consider role-based access if needed for production deployment
- Log all control actions for audit trail

### Testing Requirements
Based on existing project testing patterns:
- **Unit Tests**: Test control components and API service methods

## Dev Notes

### Control Flow Architecture
The interactive gateway controls will follow this flow:
1. **User Interaction**: User clicks control button on gateway card
2. **Confirmation**: System shows confirmation dialog for destructive actions
3. **API Request**: Frontend sends POST request to appropriate control endpoint
4. **Backend Processing**: FastAPI endpoint calls GatewayManager method
5. **Process Control**: GatewayManager executes the requested action
6. **Status Broadcasting**: Backend emits WebSocket event with new status
7. **UI Update**: Frontend receives WebSocket event and updates display

### Button State Management
Each control button will have sophisticated state management:
- **Idle**: Default state, button ready for interaction
- **Loading**: Action in progress, button disabled with spinner
- **Success**: Brief success state before returning to appropriate idle state
- **Error**: Error state with option to retry or view error details

### User Experience Considerations
**Immediate Feedback**: 
- Buttons must provide immediate visual feedback when clicked
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous actions
- Success/error states provide clear action outcome

**Contextual Controls**:
- Start button only enabled when gateway is stopped
- Stop button only enabled when gateway is running
- Restart button enabled for both running and stopped gateways
- Disabled buttons show tooltip explaining why they're unavailable

**Confirmation Flow**:
- Stop and Restart actions require user confirmation
- Start action proceeds immediately (non-destructive)
- Confirmation dialogs include gateway identification and action description

### Error Handling Strategy
**Frontend Error Handling**:
- Network errors: Show retry option with exponential backoff
- API errors: Display specific error message from backend
- Timeout errors: Provide option to check status manually
- Validation errors: Highlight invalid states and provide guidance

**Backend Error Handling**:
- Process management errors: Return detailed error information
- Gateway state conflicts: Return current state and valid actions
- Resource limitations: Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- System errors: Log detailed information for debugging

### Security Considerations
**Action Authorization**:
- All control endpoints require proper authentication
- Consider implementing role-based permissions for production
- Log all control actions with user identification and timestamp

**Input Validation**:
- Validate gateway IDs against active gateway pool
- Sanitize all input parameters to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Performance Optimization
**UI Responsiveness**:
- Use optimistic updates for immediate user feedback
- Implement proper loading states to prevent UI blocking
- Cache gateway status to avoid unnecessary re-renders

**API Efficiency**:
- Implement request debouncing to prevent rapid-fire actions
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes for efficient error handling
- Consider implementing request cancellation for long-running operations

### Testing Strategy
**Unit Testing Focus**:
- Component rendering with different button states
- API service method behavior with various response scenarios
- Event handling and user interaction flows

**Integration Testing Focus**:
- End-to-end control flow from UI button to backend action
- WebSocket integration for real-time status updates
- Error handling across the entire control pipeline

**Manual Testing Scenarios**:
- Test all control actions with actual gateways
- Verify real-time UI updates reflect backend changes
- Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Validate accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Confirm responsive design with control additions
