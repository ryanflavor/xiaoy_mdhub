# Story 4.2: Main Status Dashboard UI

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** system administrator, 
**I want** to see a main dashboard page that visualizes the real-time status of all active gateways at a glance, 
**so that** I can quickly assess the overall health of the system.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The main dashboard page is created in Next.js.
2. It displays each active gateway's ID, type, priority, and real-time health status received via WebSocket.
3. The "canary" contract monitor UI is implemented.
4. All UI components are built using `Shadcn/ui`.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.1, the system now has:
- **WebSocket Integration**: Fully functional WebSocket service in `apps/api/app/services/websocket_manager.py`
- **Real-time Event Broadcasting**: Gateway status updates and system logs pushed to all connected clients
- **Shared Types**: Complete TypeScript interfaces in `packages/shared-types/src/websocket.ts`
- **Frontend WebSocket Service**: WebSocket client service with reconnection logic in `apps/web/src/services/websocket.ts`
- **Event Message Format**: Structured JSON format for gateway status and system events

### Data Models
**Gateway Status Display Format** (from existing WebSocket implementation):
```json
{
  "event_type": "gateway_status_change",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-24T10:30:45.123Z",
  "gateway_id": "ctp_main_account",
  "gateway_type": "ctp",
  "previous_status": "HEALTHY",
  "current_status": "UNHEALTHY",
  "priority": 1,
  "metadata": {
    "connection_status": "CONNECTED|DISCONNECTED",
    "last_tick_time": "2025-06-24T10:30:40.000Z",
    "canary_status": "ACTIVE|INACTIVE"
  }
}
```
[Source: Story 4.1 implementation]

**Canary Contract Monitor Data** (based on FR6 requirements):
```json
{
  "contract_symbol": "au2412",
  "last_tick_time": "2025-06-24T10:30:45.123Z",
  "tick_count_1min": 45,
  "status": "ACTIVE|STALE|INACTIVE",
  "threshold_seconds": 30
}
```

### Component Specifications
**Dashboard Layout Requirements**:
- Main dashboard must be the default route (`/`) for immediate system status visibility
- Grid-based layout to accommodate multiple gateways
- Real-time status indicators with color coding (Green=HEALTHY, Red=UNHEALTHY, Yellow=RECOVERING)
- Gateway cards showing: ID, type, priority, current status, last update time
- Canary contract monitoring section with tick heartbeat visualization
- System-wide health summary at top of dashboard
[Source: docs/prd/03-2-requirements.md#FR10]

**UI Component Requirements using Shadcn/ui** [Source: docs/architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]:
- Use `Card` components for gateway status display
- Use `Badge` components for status indicators
- Use `Alert` components for system notifications
- Use `Separator` components for visual organization
- Use `Skeleton` components for loading states

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: docs/architecture/09-8-unified-project-structure-monorepo.md]:
- Main dashboard page: `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` (Next.js App Router root)
- Dashboard components: `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/` (new directory)
  - `gateway-status-card.tsx`
  - `canary-monitor.tsx` 
  - `system-health-summary.tsx`
- Dashboard hooks: `apps/web/src/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts` (new file)
- Dashboard types: Extend existing `packages/shared-types/src/websocket.ts`

### Technical Constraints
- **UI Library**: Must use Shadcn/ui components exclusively [Source: docs/architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **TypeScript**: All components must be fully typed [Source: docs/architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **WebSocket Integration**: Use existing WebSocket service from Story 4.1 [Source: apps/web/src/services/websocket.ts]
- **Environment Variables**: Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` pattern for client-side configuration [Source: docs/architecture/11-10-coding-standards.md]
- **Responsive Design**: Dashboard must be responsive for different screen sizes
- **Real-time Updates**: UI must update immediately when WebSocket events are received

### Integration with Existing Components
**WebSocket Service Integration**:
- Connect to existing WebSocket service on component mount
- Subscribe to `gateway_status_change` and `system_log` events
- Handle connection status and display connectivity indicators
- Implement error handling for WebSocket disconnections

**Shared Types Integration**:
- Import WebSocket message types from `packages/shared-types/src/websocket.ts`
- Extend types if needed for dashboard-specific data structures
- Ensure type safety across all WebSocket message handling

### Authentication Integration
Based on NFR8 requirement for username/password authentication:
- Dashboard should only be accessible after authentication
- Consider implementing authentication check in page component
- Display user context if authentication system is available

### Testing Requirements
Based on existing project testing patterns:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual dashboard components with Jest
- **Integration Tests**: Test WebSocket integration with dashboard components
- **Manual Testing**: Visual validation of real-time updates and responsive design

## Dev Notes

### Dashboard Design Considerations
The main dashboard is the primary interface for system administrators to monitor gateway health. Key design principles:
- **At-a-glance status**: Critical information should be immediately visible
- **Real-time updates**: Status changes must be reflected instantly via WebSocket
- **Visual hierarchy**: Use color coding and typography to prioritize information
- **Scalability**: Design should accommodate multiple gateways without cluttering

### WebSocket Data Flow
The dashboard will subscribe to the following WebSocket events from Story 4.1:
1. **Gateway Status Events**: Real-time gateway health changes
2. **System Log Events**: High-priority system notifications  
3. **Connection Events**: WebSocket connectivity status
4. **Canary Events**: Contract heartbeat monitoring updates

### Shadcn/ui Component Strategy
Leverage the following Shadcn/ui components for consistent design:
- `Card`: Primary container for gateway status information
- `Badge`: Status indicators with semantic colors
- `Alert`: System notifications and warnings
- `Skeleton`: Loading states during data fetch
- `Separator`: Visual organization of dashboard sections
- `Button`: Future interactive controls (Story 4.3)

### State Management Approach
Use React's built-in state management with custom hooks:
- `use-dashboard-data.ts`: Central hook for WebSocket data and state
- Local component state for UI-specific interactions
- Avoid external state management libraries unless complexity increases

### Performance Considerations
- Implement proper WebSocket message throttling to prevent UI overwhelming
- Use React.memo() for gateway cards to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Consider virtualization if gateway count becomes very large
- Optimize re-renders by structuring state updates efficiently

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on component rendering and prop handling
- **Integration Tests**: Test WebSocket message handling and state updates
- **Visual Testing**: Validate responsive design and Shadcn/ui integration
- **Manual Testing**: Real-time updates with actual gateway status changes

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] Jest Integration Tests: location: `apps/web/__tests__/dashboard/dashboard-integration.test.tsx`
- [x] Manual Testing: Real-time WebSocket updates and responsive design

Manual Test Steps:
- Start backend service: `cd apps/api && make dev`
- Start frontend: `cd apps/web && npm run dev`
- Navigate to main dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`
- Verify WebSocket connection indicator shows "Connected"
- Use backend to simulate gateway status changes
- Verify gateway cards update in real-time with correct status colors
- Test canary contract monitor displays tick heartbeat
- Resize browser window to test responsive design
- Check that Shadcn/ui components render consistently
- Test with multiple gateways to verify grid layout scales properly
- Verify system health summary aggregates gateway statuses correctly
