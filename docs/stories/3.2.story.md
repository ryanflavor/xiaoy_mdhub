# Story 3.2: Automated Failover Logic

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** the system,
**I want** the Quote Aggregation Engine to listen for health status changes and automatically switch to a backup data source when a primary source fails,
**so that** downstream clients experience zero data interruption.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Event Subscription**: The aggregation engine subscribes to gateway status events.
2. **Failover Detection**: When a primary source is marked `UNHEALTHY`, the engine finds the next-highest priority healthy backup.
3. **Contract Migration**: Contract subscriptions are seamlessly switched to the new backup source.
4. **Event Logging**: The failover event is logged in detail.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1, the Health Monitoring Service is complete with:
- **HealthMonitor Service**: Comprehensive health monitoring service with periodic health checks for vnpy connections and canary contract heartbeat monitoring
- **Event Bus System**: Internal asyncio-based event system for health status change notifications
- **Gateway Status Tracking**: Real-time gateway status (`HEALTHY`, `UNHEALTHY`, `CONNECTING`, `DISCONNECTED`) for all active gateways
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in resource usage tracking and health check latency monitoring
- **Integration Points**: HealthMonitor integrated with FastAPI application lifecycle and enhanced health endpoint

### Data Models
Based on existing architecture and failover requirements:
- **MarketDataAccount**: Already defined with priority field for failover ordering [Source: architecture/05-4-data-models.md#4]
  - `priority` field (lower number = higher priority) for failover ordering
  - `is_enabled` boolean for active account filtering
  - `gateway_type` for CTP/SOPT type matching
- **Gateway Status Events**: From Story 3.1 event bus system
  - Event format: `{"event_type": "gateway_status_change", "gateway_id": "...", "current_status": "UNHEALTHY"}`
- **Aggregation Engine State**: Need to track active contract subscriptions per gateway
  - Current primary gateway per contract symbol
  - Backup gateway priority queue per contract
  - Contract subscription status tracking

### API Specifications
Based on existing gateway manager and aggregation patterns:
- **Event Bus Integration**: Subscribe to health events from `apps/api/app/services/event_bus.py`
- **Gateway Manager Interface**: Use existing gateway manager for contract subscription management
- **ZMQ Publisher**: Maintain seamless tick publishing through gateway switches [Source: architecture/03-2-high-level-architecture.md#2.3]

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/09-8-unified-project-structure-monorepo.md]:
- Quote Aggregation Engine: `apps/api/app/services/quote_aggregation_engine.py` (new file)
- Gateway Manager integration: `apps/api/app/services/gateway_manager.py` (exists, needs failover methods)
- Event Bus integration: `apps/api/app/services/event_bus.py` (exists from Story 3.1)
- Main application integration: `apps/api/app/app.py` (needs aggregation engine startup)

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (latest) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Core Trading Library**: vnpy 4.0.0 for gateway management [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Event System**: Python asyncio for event subscription and processing
- **Data Distribution**: ZeroMQ (pyzmq) for tick publishing continuity [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]

### Core Workflow Integration
Based on automated failover sequence [Source: architecture/07-6-core-workflows.md#6]:
- **Health Event Subscription**: Listen for `gateway_status_change` events from HealthMonitor
- **Failover Decision Engine**: Evaluate gateway priorities and health status to select backup
- **Contract Migration**: Seamlessly transfer contract subscriptions between gateways
- **Zero-Interruption Publishing**: Maintain continuous ZMQ tick publishing during gateway switches

### Technical Constraints
- **Async Operations**: Failover processing must be non-blocking using asyncio [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Environment Variables**: Failover behavior configurable via environment variables [Source: architecture/11-10-coding-standards.md#10]
- **Zero Downtime**: Contract subscriptions must transfer without tick data gaps
- **Resource Management**: Failover logic should not impact normal tick processing performance
- **Type Safety**: All failover events must use proper TypeScript interfaces for frontend integration [Source: architecture/11-10-coding-standards.md#10]

### Integration with Existing Components
From Story 3.1 foundations:
- **Event Bus System**: Subscribe to health status change events using established event format
- **Gateway Manager**: Extend with failover-specific contract subscription methods
- **HealthMonitor**: Consume health status events without modifying health monitoring logic
- **Database Service**: Query account priorities and enabled status for failover decisions

### Aggregation Engine Architecture
Core failover decision engine:
- **Event-Driven Design**: React to health status changes asynchronously
- **Priority-Based Selection**: Use MarketDataAccount.priority field for backup selection
- **Contract State Management**: Track active subscriptions per gateway and contract
- **Failover Coordination**: Orchestrate contract migration between gateways

**Example Failover Event Flow:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "failover_executed", 
  "timestamp": "2025-06-24T10:30:45.123Z",
  "failed_gateway_id": "ctp_main_account",
  "backup_gateway_id": "ctp_backup_account",
  "affected_contracts": ["rb2601", "rb2505", "i2501"],
  "failover_duration_ms": 150,
  "metadata": {
    "primary_priority": 1,
    "backup_priority": 2,
    "contracts_migrated": 3,
    "health_trigger": "canary_timeout"
  }
}
```

### Testing Requirements
Based on existing testing patterns from Story 3.1:
- **Unit Tests**: Aggregation engine logic with mocked event bus and gateway manager
- **Integration Tests**: Full failover cycle with real health events and gateway manager
- **Service Tests**: Aggregation engine startup and event subscription
- **Failover Scenario Tests**: Gateway failure detection and backup selection validation

## Dev Notes

### Aggregation Engine Strategy
The QuoteAggregationEngine should:
- Run as background asyncio tasks for event processing
- Maintain real-time state of contract subscriptions per gateway
- React to health events within configurable timeouts (default: 5 seconds)
- Support configurable failover policies (immediate, delayed, manual override)
- Handle multiple simultaneous gateway failures gracefully

### Integration with Gateway Manager
The existing `gateway_manager.py` needs extension:
- Add failover-specific contract subscription methods (migrate_contracts, bulk_subscribe)
- Provide contract subscription status queries for state tracking
- Support atomic contract migration operations to prevent tick gaps
- Ensure failover operations don't interfere with normal gateway operation

### Event Bus Integration Considerations
Health event subscription should be:
- Resilient to event bus failures (retry logic)
- Type-safe with proper event data validation
- Efficient with minimal latency for failover triggers
- Extensible for future event types (manual failover, recovery events)

### Failover Decision Algorithm
Priority-based selection logic:
- Query enabled accounts from database with ascending priority order
- Filter by gateway health status (must be HEALTHY)
- Match gateway types when possible (prefer same type for contract compatibility)
- Fall back to different gateway types if necessary (CTP ↔ SOPT)
- Handle edge cases: no healthy backups, all gateways same priority

**Example Priority Selection:**
```python
# Account priority configuration
accounts = [
    {"id": "ctp_main", "priority": 1, "gateway_type": "ctp", "is_enabled": True},
    {"id": "ctp_backup1", "priority": 2, "gateway_type": "ctp", "is_enabled": True},
    {"id": "sopt_backup", "priority": 3, "gateway_type": "sopt", "is_enabled": True}
]

# Failover: ctp_main (pri 1) fails → select ctp_backup1 (pri 2)
# If ctp_backup1 also fails → select sopt_backup (pri 3)
```

### Contract Migration Strategy
Seamless subscription transfer:
- Pre-validate backup gateway health before starting migration
- Unsubscribe from failed gateway contracts (if gateway still responsive)
- Subscribe to same contracts on backup gateway
- Monitor for successful tick reception on new gateway
- Implement rollback logic if migration fails

### Performance Considerations
- Failover execution must complete within 200ms for zero-interruption experience
- Use asyncio for concurrent contract migrations across multiple contracts
- Implement failover timeout controls to prevent hanging operations
- Monitor aggregation engine resource usage to ensure it doesn't impact tick processing

**Expected Performance Metrics:**
- **Failover Execution Time**: <200ms from health event to backup publishing
- **Contract Migration**: <50ms per contract subscription transfer
- **Memory Usage**: <5MB additional RAM for aggregation engine state tracking
- **CPU Usage**: <1% additional utilization during normal operation
- **Event Processing**: <10ms from health event reception to failover decision
- **ZMQ Publishing Continuity**: Zero tick gaps during gateway switching

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Gateway Communication Errors**: Retry contract subscriptions with exponential backoff
- **Event Bus Errors**: Log errors but continue processing other health events
- **Database Errors**: Use cached account priorities with periodic refresh
- **No Healthy Backups**: Log critical alert and maintain last working gateway if possible

### Future Extensibility
Design for future enhancements:
- Manual failover triggers from dashboard UI (Story 4.3)
- Failover metrics and analytics for reliability monitoring
- Custom failover policies per contract or gateway type
- Intelligent failover based on historical gateway performance
