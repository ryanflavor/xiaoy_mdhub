# Story 2.4: Frontend Account Management Page

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a page in the web dashboard where I can see all configured accounts and use a toggle to enable or disable them,
**so that** I can easily manage the live data source pool.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Account Management Page Created**: An "Account Management" page is created in the Next.js app.

2. **API Integration for Display**: The page fetches and displays all accounts from the `GET /api/accounts` API.

3. **Toggle Switch for Enable/Disable**: Each account has a toggle switch to update its `is_enabled` status via the `PUT /api/accounts/{id}` API.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3, the Service Integration with DB Accounts is complete with:
- **Dynamic Account Loading**: Service now queries database for enabled accounts on startup instead of using hardcoded credentials
- **Database Integration**: Robust database service integration established from Stories 2.1 and 2.2
- **Gateway Initialization**: Dynamic gateway initialization for each enabled account working correctly
- **API Foundation**: Full CRUD API from Story 2.2 provides the backend endpoints needed for frontend integration

### Data Models
- **MarketDataAccount Interface**: Exactly as defined in shared types [Source: architecture/05-4-data-models.md#4]
  - `id`: string (unique identifier like 'ctp_main_account')
  - `gateway_type`: "ctp" | "sopt" 
  - `settings`: JSON object for vnpy gateway settings (userID, password, brokerID, mdAddress, tdAddress)
  - `priority`: number (lower = higher priority, 1 = primary)
  - `is_enabled`: boolean (whether service should use this account)
  - `description`: optional string (user-friendly name)

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (latest) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript (latest) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **UI Component Library**: Shadcn/ui (latest) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **State Management**: Zustand (already configured in package.json)
- **Type Sharing**: Use shared types from `packages/shared-types` [Source: architecture/11-10-coding-standards.md#10]

### API Specifications
Based on REST API specification [Source: architecture/06-5-api-specification-rest.md]:
- **GET /api/accounts**: List all configured accounts (returns array of MarketDataAccount objects)
- **PUT /api/accounts/{accountId}**: Update an existing account (for toggle switch functionality)
- Response format: 200 with updated account object

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/09-8-unified-project-structure-monorepo.md]:
- Frontend pages: `apps/web/src/pages/` or `apps/web/src/app/` (depending on Next.js app structure)
- Shared types: `packages/shared-types/src/accounts.ts` (already exists from previous stories)
- API client services: `apps/web/src/services/` or similar pattern for API abstraction
- UI components: `apps/web/src/components/` following Shadcn/ui patterns

### Technical Constraints
- **API Communication**: Must use dedicated service layer to abstract fetch/axios calls [Source: architecture/11-10-coding-standards.md#10]
- **Type Safety**: All API interactions must use shared TypeScript interfaces
- **UI Consistency**: All components must use Shadcn/ui library for consistent, accessible design
- **Environment Variables**: API base URL should be configurable via environment variables

### Testing Requirements
Based on existing frontend testing setup from package.json:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest with React Testing Library (already configured)
- **Component Tests**: Test account list rendering and toggle functionality
- **API Integration Tests**: Test API service layer interactions
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure toggle switches and form elements are accessible

## Dev Notes

### UI/UX Considerations
The Account Management page should:
- Display accounts in a clear, scannable format (table or card layout)
- Show critical account information at a glance (type, priority, status)
- Make the enable/disable action prominent and easy to use
- Provide clear feedback on successful/failed operations
- Handle loading and error states gracefully

### API Integration Pattern
Following coding standards for API abstraction:
- Create a dedicated AccountService class with methods for all account operations
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces from shared-types package
- Implement consistent error handling across all API calls
- Consider using a custom React hook for account data management

### Component Structure Recommendations
- Create reusable components: AccountList, AccountItem, AccountToggle
- Follow Shadcn/ui component patterns and naming conventions
- Ensure all components are properly typed with TypeScript
- Implement proper prop drilling or context if needed for deep state sharing

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Network Errors**: Show user-friendly error messages with retry options
- **API Errors**: Display specific error messages from backend responses
- **Optimistic Updates**: Implement rollback functionality if toggle update fails
- **Loading States**: Provide clear visual feedback during API operations

### Accessibility Considerations
- Toggle switches must be keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly
- Proper labeling for all interactive elements
- Color contrast compliance for status indicators
- Focus management for keyboard navigation
- ARIA labels for complex UI interactions
