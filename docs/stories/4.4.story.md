# Story 4.4: Real-time Log Viewer

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** system administrator, 
**I want** a dedicated log viewer page that displays a live stream of system logs with filtering capabilities, 
**so that** I can perform real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Dependencies

This story requires the following completed stories:
- **Story 4.1: Backend WebSocket Integration** - WebSocket endpoint and message broadcasting system
- **Story 4.2: Main Status Dashboard UI** - Dashboard infrastructure and Shadcn/ui component patterns
- **Story 4.3: Interactive Gateway Controls** - WebSocket message handling patterns and real-time UI updates

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Log Page Creation**: A dedicated "Logs" page is created at `/logs` route in Next.js App Router.
2. **Real-time Log Display**: The page displays a live feed of log messages received via WebSocket with <200ms latency from backend to UI display.
3. **Log Level Filtering**: UI controls filter logs by level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL) with immediate visual feedback on filter application.
4. **Visual Highlighting**: ERROR and CRITICAL level logs are prominently highlighted with red styling that meets WCAG 2.1 Level A contrast requirements (4.5:1 ratio minimum).
5. **Performance**: System handles high-volume log streams (1000+ messages/minute) without UI blocking or memory leaks.

### Backend Implementation Requirements
**WebSocket Log Streaming** (extend existing `apps/api/app/services/websocket_manager.py`):
```python
async def broadcast_log_message(self, log_entry: LogEntry):
    """Broadcast log message to all connected WebSocket clients"""
    message = SystemLogMessage(
        event_type=WebSocketEventType.SYSTEM_LOG,
        level=log_entry.level,
        message=log_entry.message,
        source=log_entry.module,
        timestamp=log_entry.timestamp.isoformat(),
        metadata=log_entry.details
    )
    await self.broadcast_to_all(message.dict())
```

## Dev Notes

### Log Viewer Architecture
The real-time log viewer will follow this data flow:
1. **Backend Logging**: System generates log messages through standard Python logging
2. **WebSocket Handler**: Custom log handler captures messages and forwards to WebSocket manager
3. **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Messages broadcast to all connected clients as SystemLogMessage
4. **Frontend Reception**: Log viewer hook receives WebSocket messages in real-time
5. **Client-side Filtering**: Messages filtered based on current filter settings
6. **UI Display**: Filtered messages displayed in virtualized scrollable list
7. **User Interaction**: Users can filter, search, and interact with log entries

### Log Buffer Management
**Memory Efficiency Strategy**:
- **Fixed Buffer Size**: Maintain maximum 1000 log entries in memory
- **FIFO Cleanup**: Remove oldest entries when buffer exceeds limit
- **Filter-aware Buffering**: Keep filtered results separate from raw buffer
- **Lazy Loading**: Load log details on demand for expandable entries

### Real-time Performance Considerations
**Stream Processing**:
- **Batched Updates**: Group rapid log messages for efficient React updates
- **Debounced Filtering**: Prevent excessive re-filtering during rapid input changes
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle thousands of log entries without DOM performance issues
- **Background Processing**: Use Web Workers for heavy filtering operations if needed

### Visual Design Specifications
**Log Level Color Coding**:
- **DEBUG**: Muted gray text for low importance
- **INFO**: Standard text color for normal information
- **WARN**: Amber/yellow highlighting for warnings
- **ERROR**: Red highlighting with bold text for errors
- **CRITICAL**: Red background with white text for critical issues

**Layout Design**:
- **Three-column Layout**: Timestamp | Level | Message + Source
- **Expandable Metadata**: Click to expand additional log context
- **Filter Sidebar**: Collapsible left sidebar for filter controls
- **Status Bar**: Bottom bar showing connection status and log statistics

### Error Handling Strategy
**WebSocket Connection Issues**:
- **Connection Loss**: Display connection status and attempt reconnection
- **Message Parsing Errors**: Log client-side errors without breaking UI
- **Buffer Overflow**: Gracefully handle high-volume log streams
- **Filter Errors**: Provide user feedback for invalid filter expressions

**User Experience During Errors**:
- **Offline Indicators**: Clear visual feedback when WebSocket disconnected
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic reconnection with user-controlled retry
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly error descriptions with recovery suggestions
- **Degraded Mode**: Allow viewing cached logs when real-time unavailable

### Advanced Features Implementation
**Search and Filtering**:
- **Regex Support**: Allow regular expression patterns in search
- **Saved Filters**: Store frequently-used filter combinations
- **Quick Filters**: Preset buttons for common filter scenarios (errors only, last hour, etc.)
- **Filter History**: Remember recent filter settings

**Export and Analysis**:
- **JSON Export**: Full log data with metadata for analysis tools
- **CSV Export**: Simplified format for spreadsheet analysis
- **Time Range Export**: Export logs from specific time periods
- **Filtered Export**: Export only currently filtered log entries

### Testing Strategy
**Unit Testing Focus**:
- Log entry component rendering with different log levels
- Filter component behavior with various input combinations
- Hook functionality for WebSocket message processing and filtering
- Buffer management logic for memory efficiency

**Integration Testing Focus**:
- End-to-end log streaming from backend to frontend display
- Real-time filtering performance with high-volume log streams
- WebSocket connection handling and recovery scenarios
- Export functionality with various log data sets

**Performance Testing Scenarios**:
- High-volume log streams (1000+ messages/minute)
- Large log buffer management (10,000+ entries)
- Rapid filter changes and search input
- Memory usage monitoring during extended sessions
- UI responsiveness under load

**Manual Testing Checklist**:
- Navigate to `/logs` page and verify layout
- Test real-time log message display via WebSocket
- Test all filter options (level, module, search, date)
- Verify ERROR level highlighting is prominent
- Test auto-scroll behavior and pause/resume controls
