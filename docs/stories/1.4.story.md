# Story 1.4: ZMQ Tick Publishing

## Status: Done

## Story

**As** a downstream client,  
**I want** to subscribe to a ZeroMQ endpoint and receive the `TickData` being ingested by the core service,  
**so that** the end-to-end data distribution pipeline is validated.

## Business Value

This story completes the foundational Epic 1 by establishing the critical data distribution mechanism that enables downstream trading strategies to consume market data. The ZeroMQ publisher creates the high-speed, low-latency messaging infrastructure that will serve as the backbone for all future market data consumption, validating the complete end-to-end pipeline from CTP ingestion to client consumption.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **ZeroMQ Publisher Setup**: A ZeroMQ PUB socket is bound to a configured port and integrated with the gateway manager.

2. **Tick Serialization**: Each received tick is serialized using `msgpack` format for efficient transmission.

3. **Topic-Based Publishing**: The serialized tick is published on a topic corresponding to its `vt_symbol` for selective subscription.

4. **Client Subscription Validation**: A separate test script can successfully subscribe and receive the ticks, demonstrating end-to-end connectivity.

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Publisher performance metrics are logged including:
   - Message publication rate (messages/second)
   - Serialization latency measurement
   - ZeroMQ queue depth monitoring
   - **Note**: Specific performance targets to be validated in future performance tuning story

6. **Error Resilience**: System handles ZeroMQ publishing failures gracefully with appropriate error logging and maintains system stability.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3, the gateway manager is established with comprehensive tick data ingestion, event handling, and performance monitoring. The ZMQ publisher should integrate seamlessly with the existing tick data event handler, leveraging the established gateway lifecycle management and structured logging patterns.

### Data Models
- **TickData from vnpy**: Contains symbol, datetime, last_price, last_volume, bid_price_1, ask_price_1, bid_volume_1, ask_volume_1 fields [Source: Story 1.3 implementation]
- **ZMQ Message Format**: Serialized msgpack with vt_symbol as topic key
- **Publisher Configuration**: Port binding, connection settings, queue parameters

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **ZeroMQ**: pyzmq (latest version) for high-speed, low-latency messaging [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Serialization**: msgpack for efficient binary serialization
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI with async support [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Core Trading Lib**: vnpy 4.0.0 (established in Story 1.3) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/09-8-unified-project-structure-monorepo.md]:
- Service modules: `apps/api/app/services/` (extend gateway_manager.py or create zmq_publisher.py)
- Test scripts: `apps/api/scripts/` or `apps/api/tests/`
- Configuration: Integrate with existing gateway configuration patterns

### Technical Constraints
- **Environment Variables**: ZMQ configuration (port, binding address) should use environment variables for flexibility [Source: architecture/11-10-coding-standards.md]
- **Async Patterns**: Use FastAPI async/await patterns where applicable
- **Performance**: Maintain low-latency pipeline established in Story 1.3
- **Resource Management**: Proper ZMQ socket lifecycle management

### Testing Requirements
- **Manual Testing**: Test subscriber script demonstrates end-to-end connectivity
- **Integration Test**: Test complete pipeline from tick ingestion to client consumption
- **Performance Testing**: Validate publication rate and latency metrics
- **Error Handling**: Test ZMQ failure scenarios and graceful degradation
- **Multiple Clients**: Test concurrent subscriber scenarios

### Rollback Plan
If ZMQ integration fails or causes system instability:
1. **Immediate**: Disable ZMQ publisher via environment variable (`ENABLE_ZMQ_PUBLISHER=false`)
2. **Fallback**: Revert to Story 1.3 state (tick ingestion without publishing)
3. **Recovery**: Application should start successfully without ZMQ functionality
4. **Investigation**: ZMQ publisher runs as separate component for isolation
5. **Validation**: Gateway and tick ingestion continues to function normally

## Dev Notes

### ZMQ Publisher Integration Example
```python
# Integration with existing gateway manager from Story 1.3
import zmq
import msgpack
from vnpy.trader.object import TickData

class ZMQPublisher:
    def __init__(self, port: int = 5555):
        self.context = zmq.Context()
        self.socket = self.context.socket(zmq.PUB)
        self.socket.bind(f"tcp://*:{port}")
    
    def publish_tick(self, tick: TickData):
        topic = tick.vt_symbol
        message = msgpack.packb(tick.__dict__)
        self.socket.send_multipart([topic.encode('utf-8'), message])
```

### Key Integration Points
- Extend gateway manager tick event handler to publish via ZMQ
- Leverage existing structured logging format for ZMQ metrics
- Integrate with FastAPI application startup/shutdown events for publisher lifecycle
- Reuse Mock Mode patterns from Story 1.3 for development/testing

### Epic 1 MVP Scope Considerations
**Note**: This story completes Epic 1 core objectives with minimal viable functionality:
- **Performance**: Establishes publishing foundations, specific targets deferred to dedicated performance story
- **Resilience**: Basic error handling and retry, advanced patterns reserved for Epic 3
- **Scope**: Focus on proving end-to-end pipeline, not production optimization
- **Client Interface**: Simple test script validation, production client SDKs deferred to future epics

### Future Considerations (Epic 2 Preview)
**Note**: While this story focuses on single account tick publishing, the implementation should consider:
- **Multiple Account Aggregation**: Publisher should handle ticks from multiple sources when Epic 2 adds multi-account support
- **Topic Management**: Foundation for contract-specific or account-specific topic routing
- **Client Management**: Basic patterns that can be extended to client connection tracking

### Manual Test Steps
After implementation:
1. Start the FastAPI application: `cd apps/api && make dev`
2. Verify ZMQ publisher initialization logs:
   - "ZMQ Publisher starting on port [port]" message
   - "ZMQ Publisher connected successfully" confirmation
3. Run test subscriber script: `python scripts/test_zmq_subscriber.py`
4. Verify end-to-end data flow:
   - Test script receives tick messages
   - Message format matches expected structure
   - vt_symbol topic filtering works correctly
   - Publication rate metrics logged
5. Test error resilience:
   - Stop/restart ZMQ publisher
   - Verify graceful error handling
   - Confirm tick ingestion continues during ZMQ issues
6. Validate performance monitoring:
   - Check publication rate logging
   - Verify serialization latency measurements
   - Monitor ZMQ queue depth metrics
