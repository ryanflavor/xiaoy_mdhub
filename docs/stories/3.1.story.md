# Story 3.1: Health Monitoring Service

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** system,
**I want** to continuously monitor the health of all active data sources using multiple dimensions,
**so that** I can have a real-time, accurate understanding of each source's status.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **HealthMonitor Service Module Created**: A `HealthMonitor` service module is created.

2. **Gateway Status Tracking**: It maintains a state (`HEALTHY`, `UNHEALTHY`, etc.) for each active gateway.

3. **Periodic Health Checks**: It periodically checks the `vnpy` connection status and the "canary" contract heartbeat.

4. **Status Change Events**: Any status change is logged and published to an internal event bus.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3, the Service Integration with DB Accounts is complete with:
- **Dynamic Account Loading**: Service now queries database for enabled accounts on startup instead of using hardcoded credentials
- **Gateway Manager**: `gateway_manager.py` has been fully refactored for database-driven initialization with comprehensive error handling
- **Health Endpoint**: Enhanced health endpoint provides real-time gateway status information (`/health` already exists)
- **CTP/SOPT Support**: Full support for both gateway types with proper initialization and mock mode fallbacks
- **Database Integration**: Robust database service integration established from Stories 2.1 and 2.2

### Data Models
Based on existing architecture and gateway status needs:
- **Gateway Status States**: `HEALTHY`, `UNHEALTHY`, `CONNECTING`, `DISCONNECTED` [Source: architecture/03-2-high-level-architecture.md#2.3]
- **MarketDataAccount**: Already defined and implemented [Source: architecture/05-4-data-models.md#4]
  - Gateway health monitoring will reference accounts by `id` and `gateway_type`
- **Health Status Model**: Need to define structure for tracking gateway health metrics
  - Last heartbeat timestamp
  - Connection status from vnpy
  - Canary contract tick timestamps
  - Error counts and last error messages

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (latest) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Core Trading Library**: vnpy 4.0.0 (pinned version) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **CTP Adapter**: vnpy_ctp 6.7.7.2 (pinned version) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **SOPT Adapter**: vnpy_sopt 3.7.1.0 (pinned version) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Event System**: Python asyncio for internal event bus and periodic tasks
- **Logging**: Python standard logging for status changes

### Core Workflow Integration
Based on automated failover sequence [Source: architecture/07-6-core-workflows.md#6]:
- **Health Monitoring Loop**: Continuous ping/check cycle for each gateway
- **Canary Contract Monitoring**: Track "canary" contract tick timestamps to detect stale data
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Status changes must emit events for aggregation engine consumption
- **Gateway State Management**: Track and update gateway states for failover logic

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/09-8-unified-project-structure-monorepo.md]:
- Health monitor service: `apps/api/app/services/health_monitor.py` (new file)
- Gateway manager integration: `apps/api/app/services/gateway_manager.py` (already exists, needs health callbacks)
- Event bus/system: `apps/api/app/services/event_bus.py` (new file for internal events)
- Health models: `apps/api/app/models/health_status.py` (new file for health data structures)
- Main application integration: `apps/api/app/app.py` (needs health monitor startup)

### Technical Constraints
- **Async Operations**: Health monitoring must be non-blocking using asyncio [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Environment Variables**: Health check intervals and canary contracts configurable via environment variables [Source: architecture/11-10-coding-standards.md#10]
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of vnpy gateway connection failures during health checks
- **Resource Management**: Health monitoring should not impact gateway performance
- **Type Safety**: All health status data must use proper TypeScript interfaces for frontend integration

### Integration with Existing Gateway Manager
The existing `gateway_manager.py` from Story 2.3 needs to:
- Provide health status callbacks to the HealthMonitor
- Expose vnpy gateway connection status information
- Support health check queries without disrupting normal operation
- Integrate with the event bus for status change notifications

### Event Bus Architecture
Internal event system for decoupled communication:
- **Event Types**: Gateway status changes, health check results, error events
- **Publishers**: HealthMonitor service
- **Subscribers**: Future aggregation engine (Story 3.2), WebSocket service (Story 4.1)
- **Event Format**: Structured events with timestamp, gateway_id, status, metadata

**Example Health Status Event Format:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "gateway_status_change",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-24T10:30:45.123Z",
  "gateway_id": "ctp_main_account",
  "gateway_type": "ctp",
  "previous_status": "HEALTHY",
  "current_status": "UNHEALTHY",
  "metadata": {
    "error_message": "Connection timeout after 30 seconds",
    "last_heartbeat": "2025-06-24T10:29:15.890Z",
    "canary_contract": "rb2601",
    "health_check_duration_ms": 5000,
    "retry_count": 3
  }
}
```

### Testing Requirements
Based on existing testing patterns from previous stories:
- **Unit Tests**: Health monitor service logic with mocked gateway manager
- **Integration Tests**: Full health monitoring cycle with real gateway manager
- **Service Tests**: Health monitor startup and periodic task execution
- **Error Handling Tests**: Gateway failure scenarios and recovery detection

## Dev Notes

### Health Monitoring Strategy
The HealthMonitor service should:
- Run as background asyncio tasks, one per active gateway
- Perform non-intrusive health checks that don't affect trading operations
- Maintain gateway health history for trend analysis (future enhancement)
- Support configurable health check intervals (default: 30 seconds)
- Handle edge cases like gateway restarts and connection recovery

### Integration with Gateway Manager
The existing `gateway_manager.py` needs minimal changes:
- Add health status query methods that return vnpy connection status
- Provide callback mechanism for health status updates
- Ensure health checks don't interfere with normal gateway operation
- Support health monitor queries for both CTP and SOPT gateway types

### Event Bus Design Considerations
Internal event system should be:
- Lightweight and fast (asyncio-based, not external message queue)
- Type-safe with proper event data structures
- Extensible for future event types (failover, recovery, errors)
- Decoupled to allow multiple subscribers (aggregation engine, WebSocket, etc.)

### Canary Contract Configuration
Health monitoring requires:
- Configurable canary contracts per gateway type (e.g., CTP: "rb2601", SOPT: "rb2601")
- Environment variable configuration for canary contract symbols
- Fallback behavior when canary contracts are not available
- Support for different contract naming conventions between CTP and SOPT

**Example Canary Contract Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Health monitoring configuration
HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=30
HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=10
CANARY_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=60

# CTP canary contracts (high-liquidity iron ore futures)
CTP_CANARY_CONTRACTS=rb2601,rb2505
CTP_CANARY_PRIMARY=rb2601

# SOPT canary contracts  
SOPT_CANARY_CONTRACTS=rb2601,rb2505
SOPT_CANARY_PRIMARY=rb2601

# Fallback behavior
HEALTH_CHECK_FALLBACK_MODE=connection_only  # Options: connection_only, skip_canary
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Gateway Communication Errors**: Mark as UNHEALTHY but continue monitoring
- **Event Bus Errors**: Log errors but don't crash health monitoring
- **Configuration Errors**: Fail fast on startup with clear error messages
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for health checks

### Future Extensibility
Design for future enhancements:
- Health check metrics collection (response times, error rates)
- Multiple canary contracts per gateway for redundancy
- Health status persistence for historical analysis
- Custom health check plugins for different gateway types

### Performance Considerations
- Health checks must be non-blocking and lightweight
- Use asyncio for concurrent health monitoring of multiple gateways
- Implement health check timeouts to prevent hanging operations
- Monitor health monitor resource usage to ensure it doesn't impact trading

**Expected Performance Metrics:**
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB additional RAM for health monitoring service
- **CPU Usage**: <2% additional CPU utilization during normal operation
- **Health Check Latency**: <100ms per gateway health check
- **Event Processing**: <1ms per health status event publication
- **Maximum Gateways**: Support monitoring up to 20 concurrent gateways
- **Monitoring Frequency**: Default 30-second intervals (configurable 10-300 seconds)
- **Resource Monitoring**: Health monitor should self-monitor and log resource usage every 5 minutes
