# Story 1.2: Core Service Application Shell

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Project Foundation & Core Service  
**Priority**: Critical (Blocks Epic 1 progression)  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Story ID**: 1.2

## User Story

**As** the system,  
**I want** to initialize a basic FastAPI application within the `apps/api` package that can be started and stopped,  
**so that** we have a runnable server process to host all backend logic.

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: FastAPI Dependencies and Configuration

- [x] Add `fastapi` and `uvicorn[standard]` to `apps/api/requirements.txt`
- [x] Create `apps/api/main.py` as the FastAPI application entry point
- [x] Configure FastAPI app with proper metadata (title, description, version)
- [x] Add development startup script in `apps/api/Makefile` or shell script

### AC2: Health Check Endpoint

- [x] Create `/health` endpoint that returns `{"status": "ok"}`
- [x] Endpoint should respond with HTTP 200 status code
- [x] Add proper response model using Pydantic for type safety
- [x] Include basic server metadata in health response (timestamp, version)
- [x] Health endpoint can be validated using curl or automated test

### AC3: Application Startup and Configuration

- [x] Create proper FastAPI application factory pattern
- [x] Add environment-based configuration (development/production)
- [x] Configure CORS for frontend integration
- [x] Set up basic logging configuration with structured output

### AC4: Server Process Management

- [x] Application can be successfully started using `uvicorn apps.api.main:app --reload`
- [x] Server responds on configured port (default: 8000)
- [x] Graceful shutdown handling implemented
- [x] Process can be stopped cleanly without hanging

### AC5: Basic Error Handling and Middleware

- [x] Add global exception handler for unhandled errors
- [x] Implement request/response logging middleware
- [x] Add basic request timeout configuration
- [x] Return proper JSON error responses with consistent format

### AC6: Development Scripts and Documentation

- [x] Add `dev` target to `apps/api/Makefile` or create shell script
- [x] Update root README.md with backend startup instructions
- [x] Add API endpoint documentation accessible via `/docs` (FastAPI auto-docs)
- [x] Include environment setup instructions for backend development

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Key Files to Create/Modify

**New Files**:
- `apps/api/main.py` - FastAPI application entry point
- `apps/api/src/__init__.py` - Python package initialization
- `apps/api/src/app.py` - Application factory and configuration
- `apps/api/src/routes/__init__.py` - Route module initialization
- `apps/api/src/routes/health.py` - Health check endpoint

**Modified Files**:
- `apps/api/requirements.txt` - Add FastAPI dependencies
- `README.md` - Update with backend startup instructions

### Dependencies to Add

```txt
fastapi>=0.104.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.24.0
pydantic>=2.5.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

### FastAPI Configuration

```python
# Basic FastAPI app configuration
app = FastAPI(
    title="Market Data Hub API",
    description="High-Availability Market Data Distribution Service",
    version="1.0.0",
    docs_url="/docs",
    redoc_url="/redoc"
)
```

### Health Endpoint Response Format

```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-23T10:30:00Z",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "environment": "development"
}
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Default environment variables
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Testing Validation Commands

```bash
# Test health endpoint after startup
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/health"

# Expected response
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-06-23T10:30:00Z","version":"1.0.0","environment":"development"}
```

## Definition of Done

- [x] Developer can run the backend service with a single command
- [x] `/health` endpoint returns expected response format
- [x] FastAPI auto-documentation is accessible at `/docs`
- [x] Server starts without errors and logs structured output
- [x] Application can be stopped gracefully (Ctrl+C)
- [x] README.md includes clear backend development instructions
- [x] All acceptance criteria are verified and tested

## Notes

- This story establishes the foundation for all backend development
- Must be completed before Story 1.3: Single Account Tick Ingestion
- Keep the implementation simple - this is just the application shell
- Focus on proper Python package structure and FastAPI best practices
- Architecture reference: docs/architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md
- PRD reference: docs/prd/06-5-epics.md
