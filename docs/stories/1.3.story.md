# Story 1.3: Single Account Tick Ingestion

## Status: Done

## Story

**As** a quantitative developer,  
**I want** the market data service to connect to a live CTP account and ingest real-time tick data,  
**so that** I can validate that our system can receive live market data feeds for trading strategy development.

## Business Value

This story establishes the critical foundation for real-time market data ingestion - the lifeblood of any quantitative trading system. Without reliable tick data ingestion, downstream trading strategies cannot function. This validates our core technical architecture's ability to connect to live market data sources, de-risking the entire Epic 1 delivery.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Gateway Initialization**: The service initializes a `vnpy_ctp` gateway instance using hardcoded test credentials and logs initialization status.

2. **Connection Health Monitoring**: Connection status is continuously monitored and logged with structured format including:
   - Initial connection attempt results
   - Connection state changes (connected/disconnected)
   - Connection duration tracking

3. **Live Data Validation**: Received `TickData` for a subscribed test contract (e.g., 'rb2501.SHFE') is logged to console with:
   - All essential tick fields (symbol, datetime, last_price, volume)
   - Data freshness validation (recent timestamps)
   - Tick reception rate monitoring

4. **Error Resilience**: System handles connection failures gracefully with appropriate error logging and maintains system stability.

5. **Basic Performance Monitoring**: System establishes performance measurement foundations:
   - Log tick processing timestamps for latency analysis
   - Count and log tick reception rate for throughput analysis
   - Monitor basic memory usage during operation
   - **Note**: Specific performance targets to be validated in future performance tuning story

6. **Connection Retry/Resilience** (OPTIONAL - Epic 1 Stretch Goal):
   - Basic reconnection attempt on connection failure (single retry with 10s delay)
   - Log retry attempts and outcomes
   - **Note**: Advanced retry mechanisms (exponential backoff, multiple attempts) deferred to Epic 3

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2, the FastAPI application shell is established with proper startup/shutdown lifecycle management, structured logging, and development tooling. The gateway integration should leverage the existing application factory pattern.

### Data Models
- **TickData from vnpy**: Contains symbol, datetime, last_price, last_volume, bid_price_1, ask_price_1, bid_volume_1, ask_volume_1 fields
- **Gateway Settings**: userID, password, brokerID, mdAddress, tdAddress per `MarketDataAccount` interface [Source: architecture/05-4-data-models.md#4]

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **vnpy**: Version 4.1.0 (pinned for stability) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **vnpy_ctp**: Version 6.7.7.2 (pinned for stability) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI with async support [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/09-8-unified-project-structure-monorepo.md]:
- Gateway modules: `apps/api/src/gateways/`
- Service modules: `apps/api/src/services/`
- Main application: `apps/api/main.py` and `apps/api/src/app.py`

### Technical Constraints
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive credentials MUST be environment variables, never hardcoded in production [Source: architecture/11-10-coding-standards.md#10]
- **For this story only**: Use hardcoded test credentials as specified in epic acceptance criteria
- **Async Patterns**: Use FastAPI async/await patterns where applicable

### Testing Requirements
- **Manual Testing**: Verify gateway connection logs and tick data reception in console output
- **Integration Test**: Test gateway initialization and cleanup lifecycle
- **Error Handling**: Test connection failure scenarios and graceful degradation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Validate that performance metrics are captured and logged
- **Basic Resilience Testing**: Test simple retry mechanism (if implemented)

### Rollback Plan
If CTP integration fails or causes system instability:
1. **Immediate**: Disable CTP gateway initialization via environment variable (`ENABLE_CTP_GATEWAY=false`)
2. **Fallback**: Revert to Story 1.2 state (FastAPI application shell only)
3. **Recovery**: Application should start successfully without CTP connectivity
4. **Investigation**: CTP integration runs as separate process/module for isolation
5. **Validation**: Health endpoint continues to function normally during CTP issues

## Dev Notes

### CTP Gateway Configuration Example
```python
# Hardcoded test credentials for Story 1.3 only
CTP_SETTINGS = {
    "userID": "test_user_id",
    "password": "test_password", 
    "brokerID": "test_broker_id",
    "mdAddress": "tcp://test.md.address:port",
    "tdAddress": "tcp://test.td.address:port"
}
```

### Key Integration Points
- FastAPI application startup/shutdown events for gateway lifecycle
- vnpy EventEngine integration for tick data handling
- Structured logging format consistent with existing health endpoint

### Epic 1 MVP Scope Considerations
**Note**: This story prioritizes Epic 1 core objectives with minimal viable functionality:
- **Performance**: Establishes monitoring foundations, specific targets deferred to dedicated performance story
- **Resilience**: Basic retry mechanism optional, advanced patterns reserved for Epic 3
- **Scope**: Focus on proving connectivity and data ingestion, not production optimization

### Future Considerations (Epic 2 Preview)
**Note**: While this story focuses on single account connectivity, the implementation should consider:
- **Multiple Account Support**: Design gateway manager to support account array/list structure
- **Account Priority Management**: Foundation for primary/backup account concepts
- **Basic Alerting Framework**: Simple logging patterns that can be extended to alerting systems

### Manual Test Steps
After implementation:
1. Start the FastAPI application: `cd apps/api && make dev`
2. Verify connection monitoring logs:
   - "CTP Gateway initializing..." message
   - "CTP Gateway connected successfully" with connection duration
   - Connection state change notifications
3. Verify data ingestion logs:
   - "Subscribed to contract: [symbol]" message  
   - "Received tick: [symbol] price=[X] volume=[Y] time=[Z]" messages
   - Data freshness validation results
   - Tick reception rate metrics (e.g., "Tick rate: X ticks/second")
4. Test error resilience and basic retry (if implemented):
   - Simulate connection failure scenarios
   - Verify single reconnection attempt with 10s delay
   - Confirm graceful error handling and logging
   - Validate system stability during connection issues
5. Validate performance monitoring:
   - Verify tick processing timestamps are logged
   - Confirm tick rate calculation and logging
   - Check memory usage monitoring output
   - **Note**: Performance targets to be established in future dedicated performance story
