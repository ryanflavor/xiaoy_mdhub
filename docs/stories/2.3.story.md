# Story 2.3: Service Integration with DB Accounts

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** system,  
**I want** to query the database on startup to get the list of active accounts, instead of using hardcoded credentials,  
**so that** my data source pool is dynamically configurable.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Remove Hardcoded Credentials**: Hardcoded account credentials from Epic 1 are removed from the system.

2. **Database Query on Startup**: On startup, the service queries the database for all accounts where `is_enabled` is true.

3. **Gateway Initialization**: A gateway instance is initialized for each active account found in the database.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2, the Account Management API is complete with:
- **Full CRUD API**: All REST endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) working correctly
- **Database Integration**: Successfully leverages existing database service from Story 2.1 with proper error handling
- **Pydantic v2 Compatibility**: Fixed schema_extra deprecation warnings for future-proof implementation
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and database error management
- **Integration Tests**: Complete test suite for all CRUD operations and error scenarios

### Data Models
- **MarketDataAccount Interface**: Exactly as defined in Story 2.1 [Source: architecture/05-4-data-models.md#4]
  - `id`: string (unique identifier like 'ctp_main_account')
  - `gateway_type`: "ctp" | "sopt" 
  - `settings`: JSON object for vnpy gateway settings (userID, password, brokerID, mdAddress, tdAddress)
  - `priority`: number (lower = higher priority, 1 = primary)
  - `is_enabled`: boolean (whether service should use this account)
  - `description`: optional string (user-friendly name)

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (latest) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Core Trading Library**: vnpy 4.0.0 (pinned version) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **CTP Adapter**: vnpy_ctp 6.7.7.2 (pinned version) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **SOPT Adapter**: vnpy_sopt 3.7.1.0 (pinned version) [Source: architecture/04-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Database**: Leverage existing SQLAlchemy models and database service from Stories 2.1 and 2.2
- **Type Sharing**: Use shared types from `packages/shared-types` [Source: architecture/11-10-coding-standards.md#10]

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/09-8-unified-project-structure-monorepo.md]:
- Service startup logic: `apps/api/app/services/gateway_manager.py` (already exists, needs modification)
- Database service: `apps/api/app/services/database_service.py` (already exists from Story 2.1)
- Main application: `apps/api/app/app.py` (needs startup integration)
- Configuration: Environment variables in `.env` file [Source: architecture/11-10-coding-standards.md#10]

### Gateway Integration Patterns
Based on core workflows [Source: architecture/07-6-core-workflows.md#6]:
- **Health Monitoring**: System supports automated failover between gateways
- **Priority-based Selection**: Lower priority number = higher priority (1 = primary)
- **Dynamic Gateway Pool**: Gateways can be initialized and managed at runtime

### Database Schema
Table structure already established [Source: architecture/08-7-database-schema.md#7]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE market_data_accounts (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    gateway_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    settings JSON NOT NULL,
    priority INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 2,
    is_enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Technical Constraints
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive information must use environment variables, never hardcoded [Source: architecture/11-10-coding-standards.md#10]
- **Startup Error Handling**: Service must handle database connection failures gracefully during startup
- **Gateway Lifecycle**: Gateway instances must be properly initialized with vnpy gateway settings
- **Version Compatibility**: Ensure vnpy 4.0.0 compatibility with CTP and SOPT adapters

### Testing Requirements
Based on existing testing patterns from Stories 2.1 and 2.2:
- **Unit Tests**: Test gateway manager service initialization with mocked database
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete database-to-gateway initialization flow
- **Service Tests**: Validate service startup behavior with various database states
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test graceful handling of database errors during startup

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] pytest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] pytest Integration Tests: location: `apps/api/tests/integration/test_service_startup.py`
- [x] Manual Service Testing: Startup validation with database accounts

Manual Test Steps:
- Set up test database with sample enabled and disabled accounts using the API from Story 2.2
- Start the service: `cd apps/api && make dev`
- Verify that only enabled accounts are loaded into gateway manager
- Check logs to confirm gateway initialization for each enabled account
- Test startup behavior with no enabled accounts
- Test startup behavior with database connection errors

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Remove hardcoded account credentials from Epic 1 (AC: 1)
  - [x] Identify and remove hardcoded CTP/SOPT credentials from service code
  - [x] Remove any static account configuration files or constants
  - [x] Update configuration to rely solely on database-driven accounts
  - [x] Ensure no fallback to hardcoded credentials remains in the system

- [x] Task 2: Implement database account loading on service startup (AC: 2)
  - [x] Modify `gateway_manager.py` to query database for enabled accounts on initialization
  - [x] Use existing database service from Story 2.1 to fetch accounts where `is_enabled=true`
  - [x] Implement proper error handling for database connection failures during startup
  - [x] Add logging to track which accounts are loaded during startup process

- [x] Task 3: Implement dynamic gateway initialization (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create gateway instances for each enabled account using vnpy gateway factories
  - [x] Map account `gateway_type` to appropriate vnpy gateway classes (CTP/SOPT)
  - [x] Pass account `settings` JSON to vnpy gateway initialization
  - [x] Implement priority-based ordering for gateway initialization (lower number = higher priority)
  - [x] Add error handling for individual gateway initialization failures

- [x] Task 4: Integrate startup process with FastAPI application lifecycle (AC: 2,3)
  - [x] Add startup event handler to `app.py` that triggers gateway manager initialization
  - [x] Ensure database is available before attempting to load accounts
  - [x] Implement graceful degradation if no enabled accounts are found
  - [x] Add health check endpoint to verify gateway initialization status

  - [x] Create manual test procedures for service validation
  - [x] Verify that service can start with accounts created via Story 2.2 API

## Dev Notes

### Gateway Manager Integration
The existing `gateway_manager.py` from Epic 1 needs to be refactored to:
- Replace hardcoded account initialization with database-driven loading
- Integrate with the database service established in Story 2.1
- Maintain compatibility with vnpy gateway lifecycle management
- Support dynamic account configuration changes (future stories)

### Database Service Leverage
Reuse the robust database service from Story 2.1:
- `database_service.py` provides `get_enabled_accounts()` method (may need implementation)
- Database session management is already established
- Error handling patterns are proven and tested

### Startup Error Handling Strategy
- **Database Unavailable**: Log error, optionally start with empty gateway pool
- **No Enabled Accounts**: Log warning, start service but with no active gateways
- **Gateway Init Failure**: Log error for specific gateway, continue with remaining gateways
- **Complete Failure**: Fail service startup with clear error message

### vnpy Integration Considerations
- Each gateway type (CTP/SOPT) requires specific vnpy adapter classes
- Gateway settings JSON structure must match vnpy expected parameters
- Gateway initialization is asynchronous and may require connection validation
- Consider gateway connection timeouts and retry logic

### Configuration Migration
The transition from hardcoded to database-driven configuration requires:
- Verification that no hardcoded credentials remain in the codebase
- Migration of existing hardcoded accounts to database (if needed)
- Documentation update for new configuration approach
- Environment variable cleanup for removed hardcoded settings
